Prediction of sentiment of any product review

this is a basic application of ML. I used Amazon Reviews Dataset to train an NLP model that uses logistic regression to classify sentiment of product reviews as positive or negative. I used nltk and scikit-learn to process text data and create features. Deployed using Flask and Heroku.
